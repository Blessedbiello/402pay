# Development Documentation

This directory contains internal development documentation, planning files, and decision logs that were created during the 402pay project development process.

## Purpose

These files are kept for historical reference and development context but are not part of the production documentation. They document:

- Architecture decisions and alternatives considered
- Implementation planning and strategy
- Compliance analysis and verification
- Development decisions and trade-offs
- Hackathon strategy and analysis
