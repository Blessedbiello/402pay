**What We've Built:**
- ✅ Proper HTTP 402 status code responses
- ✅ X-PAYMENT header implementation (client payment proofs)
- ✅ X-PAYMENT-RESPONSE header (server confirmations)
- ✅ Standard PaymentRequirements schema
- ✅ 5 working x402 example endpoints:
  - `/x402/paid-greeting` - Simple paid endpoint (0.001 SOL)
  - `/x402/paid-data` - Premium market data (0.005 SOL)
  - `/x402/paid-inference` - AI inference service (0.01 SOL)
  - `/x402/paid-image` - AI image generation (0.02 SOL)

- ✅ X402Client SDK with automatic payment flow
- ✅ x402Middleware for Express route protection
- ✅ On-chain transaction verification
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation (X402.md)

**Implementation Details:**
```typescript
// ✅ Now Properly Implemented
response.status(402).json({
  x402Version: "0.1.0",
  paymentRequirements: [{
    scheme: "exact",
    network: "solana-devnet",
    maxAmountRequired: "1000000",
    recipient: "WALLET_ADDRESS",
    resource: "/x402/paid-greeting",
    description: "Access to premium greeting service"
  }]
});

// Client automatically handles payment
const client = new X402Client({ payer: keypair });
const result = await client.paidRequest(url);
// Returns: { data, payment: { signature, amount, from, to }, response }
```

**Files Created:**
